Project Description: Dungeon Adventure (C++)

Overview

Dungeon Adventure is a console-based dungeon crawler game developed in C++. The game offers an interactive experience where players explore randomly generated dungeons, fight monsters, collect items, and upgrade their abilities. The game incorporates inventory management, procedural dungeon generation, and a loot system, providing a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

Key Features

Turn-Based Combat System 
– Players can engage in battles against monsters using attack and defense mechanics.

Inventory System 
– Players can collect and manage items such as potions, weapons, and armor.

Procedural Dungeon Generation 
– Every game session generates a unique dungeon layout, enhancing replayability.

Loot System 
– Defeated monsters drop random items that players can collect and use.

Upgrade System 
– Players can enhance their health and attack power by finding upgrade rooms.

Mini-Map Display 
– A simplified representation of the dungeon to help players navigate.

Technologies Used

C++ – Core language for game development

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
– Used to structure the game with classes like Monk, Monster, Dungeon, Room, and Inventory

STL (Standard Template Library) 
– Utilized vector, map, and set for efficient data management

Randomization (rand()) 
– Used to generate procedural dungeons and loot drops

Future Enhancements

Expand the inventory system with more item types
Introduce new enemy types and boss fights
Implement a graphical interface using SFML or SDL2
Add multiplayer functionality

This project demonstrates strong skills in C++ programming, object-oriented design, and game logic implementation, making it an excellent addition to my portfolio.
